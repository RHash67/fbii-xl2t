A login screen will appear when visiting the website.  User name and password are case-sensitive.  If you have previously logged in from a previous session on the same device, you will bypass the login screen and be taken directly to the keypad interface screen.

Upon logging onto the website, a screen will appear which simulates an FBII XL4600SM keypad.  The indicators correspond
to the keypad status LEDs.  Pressing the keypad buttons will send the corresponding keypress to the alarm system.

If the alarm system goes into alarm, the "SYSTEM ALARM" indicator will light, and an email alert will be sent to the designated
recipient.  Two emails are sent for redundancy.  Cellphone text message alerts are possible by using the appropriate
cell carrier email-to-text format.
